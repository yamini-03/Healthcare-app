These findings have important public health implications as intake of plant protein can be increased relatively easily by replacing animal protein and could have a large effect on longevity, the researchers reported. Diets high in protein from plants -- such as legumes (peas, beans and lentils), whole grains and nuts -- have been linked to a lower risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, while diets high in animal protein have been linked with a number of health problems. However, there have been conflicting findings on the association between different types of proteins and the risk of early death, so a group of researchers analyzed 32 studies that examined the risk of death from heart disease, cancer and any cause in adults aged 19 and older. During a follow-up of up to 32 years, just over 113,000 deaths occurred among more than 715,000 participants in the studies. A high intake of total protein was associated with a lower risk of all-cause death. Consumption of plant protein was associated with an 8% lower risk of death from any cause and a 12% lower risk of death from heart disease. Consumption of animal protein was not significantly associated with risk of death from heart disease or cancer. Data from 31 of the studies also showed that an additional 3% of energy from plant proteins a day was associated with a 5% lower risk of death from any cause, according to the findings published July 22 in the BMJ. Possible reasons for the beneficial effects of plant proteins include lower blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels, which might help reduce the risk of conditions such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, said Ahmad Esmaillzadeh, a professor of nutrition at Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Iran, and colleagues. Further research is required, but the study results strongly support the existing dietary recommendations to increase consumption of plant proteins in the general population, the researchers said in a journal news release. -- Robert Preidt Copyright © 2020 HealthDay.

Chan School of Public Health, in an April 5, 2021, article in Discover. For most people, moderate coffee consumption can be incorporated into a healthy diet.Hu said that moderate coffee intake—about 2–5 cups a day—is linked to a lower likelihood of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, liver and endometrial cancers, Parkinsons disease, and depression. It’s even possible that people who drink coffee can reduce their risk of early death.Early research linked coffee to diseases ranging from heart disease and asthma. But Hu noted that many participants in those studies also smoked, which may have led researchers to think that coffee was responsible for the adverse effects that are now linked with cigarettes. He added that anything people consume a lot of tends to come under scrutiny. In the past, I think a lot of people thought, Oh, coffee’s so delicious, there must be something bad about coffee, he said. So I think the good news is that [for] most people, coffee actually confers some health benefits. Certain groups should be careful about drinking coffee, according to the article. Not much is known about the effects of coffee on children, and caffeine could be harmful to pregnancies. Too much caffeine can also cause anxiety in people with panic or anxiety disorders. For those who drink coffee, experts suggest brewing it with a paper filter, because unfiltered coffee is associated with higher rates of early death, and can contain compounds that raise levels of LDL, or bad, cholesterol. They also advise not going overboard with added cream or sugar.',

Saturated fats are found in red meat, dairy products and tropical oils, including coconut and palm. They can raise cholesterol and clog arteries, according to the American Heart Association. Study author Annelise Madison, a graduate student in clinical psychology, said its a common belief that food affects your performance.Anecdotally, a lot of people struggle to focus during the time after lunch,   she said.This study looked at what short-term effect a single meal might have, Madison said.The study examined data from work done in the lab of her mentor, Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, director of the universitys Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research. That earlier study examined if high-fat meals contribute to fatigue and inflammation in cancer survivors.The new study looked at 51 women given one of two meals: one high in saturated fat, the other high in unsaturated fats. Both meals contained 930 calories and 60 grams of fat. Their mental skills were tested five hours later with a computerized challenge to distinguish targets from distraction.

Theres a seed for that!Chia Seeds-Chia has come a long way since it first sprouted out of funny pottery in TV commercials. These tiny seeds pack in 10 grams of fiber in a 2-tablespoon serving. They also contain proteins, omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and minerals like: iron, calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Chia seeds are easy to add to your favorite dishes. Sprinkle them ground or whole onto cereal, vegetables, or yogurt. Soak them in water to add to cooked cereal, or find a recipe for chia pudding as a healthy and tasty dessert.Wild Rice-Wild rice is actually a seed – a grass seed. It   s higher in protein than most other whole grains and contains 30 times more antioxidants than white rice. Wild rice is a good source of fiber, and nutrients such as: folate, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, zinc, vitamin B6, and niacin. A 2009 study in China found wild rice might be effective in lowering cholesterol and other fats in the blood. Wild rice is extremely versatile and can be substituted for white rice in any dish. It can also be a healthy addition to a salad or soup. Pumpkin Seeds-Pumpkin seeds are a tasty snack that boasts 16% of your daily iron needs in just ¼ cup. That same ¼ cup will also get you 5 grams of fiber, which is more than most nuts. In addition, pumpkin seeds are a good source of amino acids, protein, and omega-3s, as well as minerals such as zinc and magnesium. Fresh roasted pumpkin seeds – a Halloween favorite – are an excellent snack, but you can enjoy them year-round sprinkled on oatmeal, baked into muffins, mixed into smoothies, or added to homemade granola and energy bars. Pomegranate Seeds-Pomegranate seeds are small red jewels called arils. These arils have lots of fiber and 40% of your daily requirement of vitamin C.

        { title: 'What is a Variant?', id: '1',content:'By Dr. Nicola Williams, Ph.D.Reviewed by Sophia Coveney Viruses can change and alter their genetic make-up. When these changes occur, the virus may become more or less of a threat to the human host. Virologists are therefore interested in tracking the evolution of the viral genome. In the case of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is designated a single species, but there are differing kinds of    coronavirus    that can infect the patient with essentially the same disease. These different kinds of virus have been called mutants, variants, strains and sometimes subspecies, which inevitably leads to conceptual confusion. The term variant and the COVID-19 pandemic- Biologists deploy specific terminologies to describe viruses and the use of these terms has seeped into everyday use. Different types of viruses have been generally referred to as mutants, variants, subspecies, and strains, although there are important differences between them. The use of the term    variant    is only relatively recent. The term has been used in popular discourse in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. One reason for this may be the plethora of sub-disciplines and specialisms within biology, whereby scientists working in different areas of expertise tend to use different terms.Meanwhile, rather than visualize the branch of a tree, experts in public health would more likely use the term    variant of concern    (VOC) for a disease-causing biological organism or entity.The term can be particularly useful in general discourse because it can refer to both the virus and the disease, whereas the term strain is used specifically to refer to the virus.A good example of a variant is that of Delta. The Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was only very recently (Fall 2021) the most common type of coronavirus in the US.Organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have organized coronavirus variants into categories. The classifications are as follows: Variant of interest->This is a coronavirus variant that virologists are keeping a keen eye on so to speak. It is a predictive category whereby the virus has acquired certain characteristics that need to be keenly watched. Variant of concern->Here the virus is known to be more infective to the host. ',

        { title: 'COVID-19 Misconceptions', id: '2' ,content:'By Dr. Liji Thomas, MD.Reviewed by Emily Henderson, B.Sc. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been devastating in its impact. The chances are that its toll was needlessly high due to a parallel pandemic of misinformation that swept hundreds of thousands of people away from safety-driven measures into potentially harmful practices and behaviors. This article deals with some of the leading myths floating around, while not offering an exhaustive debunking of each.Risk factors->One persistent red herring has been the misconception that the introduction of 5G mobile technology is responsible for the pandemic. The rumor belies the obvious fact that COVID-19 is spreading in many regions without such technology, and therefore does not spread via radio waves. Another popular myth is that only the old, sick, and unfit get COVID-19. While these are certainly at a higher risk of infection, and severe disease, younger people can be infected, become sick, and even die. Drugs, disinfectants, and supplements->Alcohol-based sanitizers do not cause antibiotic resistance, since pathogens do not become resistant to them. Nor do they typically cause skin rashes, bleaching, or irritation, though rare incidents have been reported.The use of these sanitizers does not introduce alcohol into the body but instead improves health by helping to eliminate the virus from the hands, making them compatible with most faiths. Vaccines->Vaccinations are being rolled out at top speed, to protect those at risk of severe infection by surrounding them with a wall of healthy people with robust protective immunity against the virus.The vaccines cannot give the virus to the vaccinated individual or anyone else, because they do not contain the live virus. Hot or cold?Toasting yourself in the sun or taking a hot bath has not been proved to prevent or cure COVID-19, with countries in almost every climate zone falling prey to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Cold weather or snow doesn   t inactivate the virus, with the first wave of the pandemic hitting countries in the cold temperate zones hardest. Behavioral changes such as staying inside and covering the face with a scarf or muffler to keep out the cold may contribute to reduced transmission during winters. ',

        { title: 'COVID-19 and Heart Damage', id: '3',content:' By Dr. Liji Thomas, MD reviewed by Emily Henderson, B.Sc. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to well over 200 million infections, with a fatal outcome in over 4.5 million cases. In the survivors, most recovered completely but some showed long-haul symptoms – now often called Long COVID. Background-One important potentially long-term clinical consequence of COVID-19 seems to be heart damage. Myocarditis->Heart inflammation appears to be prominent in COVID-19, in some patients at least. This could involve both the myocardium and the pericarditis, causing severe fatigue without other obvious symptoms..ACE2 downregulation and myocardial edema->Conversely, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which acts as the viral receptor, is widespread in its distribution and has significant cardiovascular functionalities such as normal vascular permeability. Cardiac damage and long COVID->Signs and symptoms of possible heart damage after COVID-19 may include severe fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) due to neurologic disturbances, post-exertional fatigue, and higher troponin levels with an abnormal electrocardiograph, which may indicate a heart attack.Some cardiologists attribute these symptoms to cardiac damage.COVID-19 in pre-existing heart failure->In patients who already have heart failure, the outlook is poor, as the co-occurrence of COVID-19 can trigger myocardial injury, causing the patient   s heart to fail all at once. Heart failure is probably due to the cytokine storm that is associated with severe COVID-19, including elevated levels of interleukins (IL) such as IL3, IL6, IL7, and other inflammatory mediators. Clinical outcomes->More research will be needed to correlate the imaging findings with clinically important events, however. The implications must be worked out, because myocarditis puts a strain on the heart, causing over a tenth of sudden cardiac deaths in young adults, and being recognized as potentially fatal in competitive athletes.

This novel coronavirus causes mostly asymptomatic or mild infection, but in a sizable minority, it triggers a hyper-inflammatory response that leads to severe or life-threatening disease.Background->The viral genome is composed of single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) that encodes four structural proteins and a number of nonstructural and accessory proteins. The structural proteins are the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins.Monoclonal antibody EUA criteria->Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the spike protein have been found to be clinically useful in the therapy of COVID-19. At present three mAbs have received Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Available antibodies->The mAbs in question are:1) A cocktail of bamlanivimab plus etesevimab, neutralizing mAbs that recognize different epitopes that overlap each other in the RBD. These are less effective at neutralizing the newer Beta and Gamma variants of concern of the virus. Thus, their use is indicated where the prevalence of such variants is low. 2) A cocktail of casirivimab plus imdevimab, recombinant human mAbs that engage distinct non-overlapping epitopes of the RBD. This is given intravenously, but if this is non-feasible or would delay treatment, the dose is split into four subcutaneous doses given at one time. This condition is due to the limited safety and efficacy data on this route. 3) Sotrovimab, first identified in a SARS-CoV patient who recovered from the infection but found to engage an epitope in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that is common to both viruses. Why these recommendations?->The basis of this recommendation is the finding that mAbs reduced the risk of hospitalization and death when used in such patients, from randomized controlled trials.Vaccination after mAb treatment->The potential for interference with the immune response by the passively administered mAbs has led to the advice to delay COVID-19 vaccination for at least 90 days from the date of receiving the mAbs.

Reviewed by Sophia Coveney The    Twindemic    refers to the co-occurrence of both the flu and the novel coronavirus. Although these viruses differ in their pathogenesis, there is a cooperative effect thought to be induced causing both flu and COVID-19 cases to rise simultaneously and overwhelm healthcare resources. When did the term    Twindemic    appear? The term    Twindemic    first appeared in August 2020 in a New York Times article. The Times attributed the coinage of the term to Chief Strategy Officer For the Immunisation Action Coalition, LJ Tan Ph.DTheories to explain low rates of influenza in 2020=>In winter 2020, countries across the world, including Chile, Australia, South Africa, and Europe, experienced one of the mildest flu seasons recorded. Indeed, the World Health Organisation reported that <0.2% of respiratory swab specimens tested from people globally between September 2020 on January 2021 were positive for influenza viruses. This contrasts significantly with the three previous seasons from September 2017 to 2020 demonstrating an average of 17% positive testing for the influenza virus. Reasons for the occurrence of a    Twindemic    in 2021->Although the delta continues to be highly transmissible, easing of restrictions has resulted in increased mixing within populations across the world. Moreover, low influenza infections in 2020 have resulted in reduced immunity for the subsequent year, and the production of an efficacious vaccine has been difficult. The importance of vaccinations in preventing a  Twindemic ->In the United States, the center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated flu guidelines in an attempt to mitigate the effects of the    Twindemic   . In conjunction with the revised guidelines, the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine is considered to be a key means of mitigating surges in both influenza and influenza-like illnesses during the coming year. The impact of vaccinations on the Twindemic  ->Vaccination coverage tends to vary by country, however, influenza vaccination tends to be administered to infants, those who are considered to be at risk (that is, those who are immunocompromised, have chronic health conditions, are over the age of 50, are pregnant, or work in the healthcare sector).

Researchers evaluated the self-reported physical activity of more than half a million U.S. adults, as well as adult cancer cases in every state and the District of Columbia from 2013 to 2016. Scientists estimated that about 3% of cancer cases per year (about 46,000) could be attributed to inactivity — defined as getting less than 300 minutes of exercise per week. Rates of cancers of the stomach, uterus, colon, esophagus, breast, and bladder all were lower among more physically active people, particularly those who did at least 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity, such as brisk walking. That works out to about 43 minutes per day. Because this is an observational study, it doesn   t prove that increasing your physical activity will reduce your risk of cancer. But there is strong evidence that this level of activity also is associated with a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia — and possibly many common types of cancer.',

The study, published February 21 in Frontiers in Nutrition, examined data on vegetable consumption among 399,586 adults in the United Kingdom who were 56 years old on average and had never been diagnosed with heart disease. After 12 years of follow-up, participants experienced a total of 18,052 major cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, and a total of 4,406 people died of cardiovascular disease. Overall, participants consumed an average of 2.3 tablespoons (tbsp) a day of raw vegetables and 2.8 daily tbsp of cooked vegetables. When researchers compared people with the highest vegetable intake to those with the lowest consumption, raw veggies were associated with an 11 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a 15 percent lower risk of death by events like heart attacks and strokes. There didn   t appear to be any heart benefit associated with cooked vegetables. And the study also found that most of the protective effect of raw veggies might be explained by differences in participants    overall health, lifestyle habits, and socioeconomic status. This doesn   t mean cooked vegetables are bad for us, or that they can   t be part of a heart-healthy diet, says Alice Lichtenstein, DSc, a professor of nutrition science and policy and the director of the cardiovascular nutrition laboratory at Tufts University in Boston. Assessing the effect of an individual food, rather than an entire dietary pattern, does not provide the whole picture and may be misleading,   says Dr. Lichtenstein, who wasn   t involved in the study. The people who ate the most raw vegetables in the study did a lot of other things that are associated with better cardiovascular health outcomes and that may have made the impact of veggies on their own seem much smaller.',

As such, it is a priority of key players in the field of medicine to detect early symptoms of such conditions and provide an empirically-based profile of heart disease biomarkers.These data would then be triangulated into screening test results for further identification of a patient   s cardiovascular condition. Heart Disease Biomarkers->Biomarkers are present in many kinds of diseases, and their identification is an important aspect of health management as it facilitates the early detection of a certain illness and the prevention of a full-blown medical condition.Novel Biomarkers->Because of the increasing mortality rate brought about by cardiovascular and heart diseases, many contemporary researchers have focused on identifying new biomarkers that could further detect the risk for heart conditions. In 2010, the American College of Cardiology Foundation specified various areas that were found to be contributory factors to cardiovascular disease development. They are showcased in the table below. Circulating Biomarkers->Lipoprotein and apolipoprotein-Natriuretic peptide-C-reactive protein-Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2-Hemoglobin A1c-Urinary albumin Imaging->Resting ECG rate-Flow-mediated dilatation-Ankle-brachial index-Coronary calcium score-Myocardial perfusion imagingGenetic Biomarkers-Family history of cardiovascular and heart diseases, as well as genetic abnormalities, may induce the risk of illness progression.

From snapper to sole, tilapia to tilefish, there   s a wide variety of fish to choose from at your local fish counter. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends eating at least two 3-ounce servings of fish, particularly fatty fish, per week. Fatty fish that are high in omega-3 fatty acids and have been shown to reduce your risk of heart attack or stroke, include anchovies, mackerel, black cod, salmon, bluefin tuna, and striped bass. When it comes to selecting the best fish for a heart-healthy diet, it   s also important to factor in the possibility of environmental contaminants. According to the AHA and other leading health organizations, some types of fish may contain high levels of mercury and other harmful environmental chemicals. These contaminants can negate fish   s heart-health benefits and increase the risk of cancer, says David O. Carpenter, MD, a professor in environmental health sciences at the State University of New York in Albany. For your heart and health in general,   the advice should not be just to eat fish but to eat the right kinds of fish,   Dr. Carpenter says. To make sure you   re buying the best kinds of fish for your health, get up to speed about methylmercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently updated their advice about eating fish and shellfish for women and children because methylmercury is harmful to an unborn baby   s and a young child   s developing neurological system.

This system provides oxygen, and vital nutrients to the body   s organs and tissues. What is shock?->There are several forms of shock. In all types of shock, however, metabolic failure occurs, which is when the metabolic demands of the body   s tissues and organs are not met by their blood supply. The other common forms of shock include septic shock (caused by massive blood infection) and hypovolemic shock (due to massive loss in blood volume either due to bleeding or other causes). Cardiogenic shock->In cardiogenic shock, the metabolic failure is caused by inadequate circulation due to the heart not pumping effectively. In most of other forms of shock, the heart may eventually fail but in the case of cardiogenic shock, the main cause of shock in the first place is heart failure. The damage caused to the heart in cardiogenic shock may be due to myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, cardiac valve problems, obstruction of ventricular outflow or cardiomyopathy.What happens in cardiogenic shock?In most cases of cardiogenic shock, the left ventricle (the heart   s main pumping chamber) has become damaged as a result of heart attack. As the heart fails to pump enough blood to meet the body   s demands for oxygen and nutrients, cells in vital organs and tissues begin to die. This can eventually lead to serious adverse events such as cardiac arrest, and the blood may stop being pumped altogether.Symptoms->The symptoms of cardiogenic shock include:Fast breathing rate-Fast heart beat-Shortness of breath-Cold hands and feet-Confusion-Sweating-Weak pulse-Loss of consciousness ',lin:'https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/12/09/17/11/vegetables-1085063__340.jpg',

Cholesterol->High levels of cholesterol in the blood may be linked to an increased risk of heart disease and cardiovascular events. Blood tests to measure the levels of cholesterol should be recommended for all men over the age of 35 on a regular basis.Blood pressure->Screening for hypertension should be done at least once in two years for all men, regardless of age. Screening for prostate cancer->Screening for prostate cancer should be carried out annually for men over the age of 50 years with a blood test to measure prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and a digital rectal exam. Men at high risk of the condition, due to family history, may need to begin screening early at 40 or 45 years of age.Colorectal cancer->Early detection and treatment of colorectal cancer can significantly improve the outcome of patients. Screening tests usually begin for men at the age of 50, although it may be recommended early for men with a family history of the condition.Diabetes->As up to a third of patients with high levels of glucose in their blood are not aware of their diabetes, screening for the condition can help to detect it and reduce the risk of complications.Early detection of type 2 diabetes in people who are in the pre-diabetes stage introduces the possibility of making changes to diet and lifestyle before there is a real need for medical treatment.

        { title: 'What is Male Pattern Baldness?', id: '2' ,content:'By Hidaya Aliouche, B.Sc. Reviewed by Emily Henderson, B.Sc. Male pattern baldness is also known as androgenic alopecia. It is the cause of more than 95% of all cases of pattern hair loss; This includes baldness in men and thinning of hair in women. The primary and hormones responsible for male pattern baldness are testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The enzyme 5-alpha reductase regulates the conversion of testosterone to DHT. These elevated levels of DHD result in miniaturization of the half follicle, a shortened period of the growth phase of the half-cycle, known as the anagen phase, and eventual hair loss. The anatomy of the hair follicle->The hair growth cycle consists of three phases: anagen, catagen, and telogen. Anagen, known as the growth phase, lasts between three and 10 years. during this phase rapid cell division occurs in the hair bulb and dermal papilla. New hairs also begin to protrude from the scalp.Epidemiology of male pattern hair loss->The most common group affected by male pattern baldness are Caucasians, followed by Asians, and African Americans. The incidence is correlated with the age in Caucasian males, with 50% affected by the age of 50, and up to 80% affected by the age of 70. In females increase in incidence typically increases after menopause.Pathophysiology of male pattern baldness->In the anagen phase, the activation of the androgen receptor shortens the anagen growth phase in the course of the hair growth cycle. Excessive activation, which may occur in androgenetic alopecia, leads to minimization of the follicle through a progressively shorter anagen phase is, resulting in thinner and shorter hair follicles. These thinner and shorter hair follicles may not be capable of penetrating through the epidermis. Pathological specimens show a decreased ratio of anagen to telogen hair, with a 5:0 ratio versus a 12:1 ratio in normal hair.Clinical features->If not treated in the early stages, hair loss can progress, resulting in a complete loss of hair, particularly on the crown. Using a dermatoscope, which is a handheld epiluminescent microscope, two to five terminal hairs can be seen emerging from a single pore. ',

        { title: 'Insight into Male PCOS', id: '3',content:'By Dr. Sanchari Sinha Dutta, Ph.D. Reviewed by Aimee Molineux Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a type of endocrine disorder characterized by an abnormal menstrual cycle and the presence of multiple small cysts on the ovaries. The condition is developed due to excessive production of male sex hormones (androgens) by the ovaries. What is polycystic ovary syndrome?Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) develops when the endocrine system of a woman fails to produce enough hormones necessary for ovulation (release of mature eggs from the ovary). This leads to the development of multiple small cysts on the ovaries. What is male PCOS?->Male relatives of women with PCOS may develop similar clinical characteristics (male PCOS) because of the inheritance of certain susceptible genes responsible for the PCOS pathogenesis. Besides hormonal and metabolic abnormalities, male PCOS is characterized by early-onset androgenetic alopecia (baldness), hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth anywhere on the body), or acne.Men with PCOS-like symptoms are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. In this context, studies have shown that the first-degree relatives of women with PCOS are genetically more likely to have insulin resistance, obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and early-onset androgenetic alopecia. The presence of PCOS-like characteristics can predispose men to develop prostate cancer, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostatitis later in life. Hormonal characteristics of male PCOS->Men with early-onset androgenetic alopecia exhibit similar hormonal changes associated with PCOS. Moreover, there is an association between male PCOS and the hormonal landscape of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Given its high prevalence among male family members of women with PCOS, early-onset androgenetic alopecia is considered to be a prominent sign of male PCOS.The shared hormonal landscape between early-onset androgenetic alopecia and PCOS includes reduced levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, sex hormone-binding globulin, testosterone, and epitestosterone, and increased levels of luteinizing hormone, prolactin, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Metabolic characteristics of male PCOS->Early-onset androgenetic alopecia is associated with a number of metabolic changes, including reduced insulin sensitivity and sex hormone-binding globulin levels.

Retroviruses invade host cells and alter the genome of that cell by inserting a copy of its RNA genome.Prevalence of HIV amongst women->In 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recorded 36,400 new HIV infections in the United States. Of these, 18% were female, a proportion which has remained stable across the past decade. Most new infections among women are caused by sexual intercourse with an infected man, although women who are intravenous drug users are at high risk for transmission.Who is at risk?->All women are at risk of contracting HIV, but this risk is significantly elevated in certain groups. These include:--Women who have unprotected sex with an infected man. Women are more likely than men to contract HIV during vaginal sex as the surface areas of the vagina is larger than the penis, and semen can remain in the vagina for several days after intercourse.--Women who use injectable drugs. Sharing needles and syringes significantly increase the risk of contracting HIV and increases the likelihood of engaging in other risky behaviours such as unprotected sex.--Young women, especially adolescent girls are at higher risk of HIV transmission than older women, especially those with an insufficiently developed reproductive tract. HIV, women, and reproduction->Early studies of women with HIV infection found that fertility rates were approximately 25% - 40% lower in HIV-positive women than HIV-negative women, leading to an assumption that the HIV virus could impact fertility. One possible mechanism suggested that HIV could lead to premature failure of the ovaries.HIV and health issues->HIV can cause several health problems that are unique to women.Gynecological problems->HIV-positive women are at risk of the same range of gynecological issues as HIV-negative women, however, the use of ART, suppressed immunity and the presence of the HIV virus impact the severity and treatment of such issues.',

It is a breach of human rights and causes significant long-lasting physical and psychological harm and even death. The statistics estimate that it is highly likely that any given person knows at least one woman who has been subject to physical or sexual violence, even though they may not be aware of it.Physical and sexual violence-Alarmingly, around 1 in 3 women, roughly 30%, have suffered from physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner or sexual violence by a non-intimate partner, according to a 2018 data analysis conducted by WHO on behalf of the UN Interagency working group.

Yet, male sex hormones, namely androgens, are also essential for female health, physical and emotional.Androgen Production in Women->About 25% of androgens in women come from the adrenal glands, another 25% from the ovaries, and the rest peripheral tissues. The chief precursors of androgens in the body are DHEA-S – almost always in the adrenal glands - DHEA and androstenedione. The latter two are produced in the adrenals, ovaries, and peripheral tissues by conversion.Testosterone and Cardiometabolic Disease->Estrogen promotes vasodilation, reduces the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, is anti-inflammatory, and thus promotes vascular health before menopause. Testosterone, in contrast, acts on the blood vessels both directly and following its conversion to estradiol.Cutaneous Effects->The most powerful androgenic effect on the hair follicles is mediated by dihydrotestosterone, with shrinkage and a shorter growth phase of the follicle, resulting in hair loss.Mood and Cognition->The brain is shaped by estrogens during fetal development and continues to be affected. During the reproductive years, testosterone levels in the brain exceed those of estradiol by several times.Musculoskeletal Function->Androgen receptors on bone-forming cells mean that low androgen levels, as in post-menopausal women, are associated with reduced bone density and increased risk of fractures in the hip and spine.Breast/Endometrial Tissue->The high aromatase levels in the breast tissue mean that testosterone is rapidly and abundantly converted to estrogen, producing proliferative effects on the breast. Interestingly, however, experimental results show the opposite, with testosterone demonstrating anti-proliferative effects while promoting apoptosis within breast tissue.Testosterone also inhibits estrogen receptor alpha and has been found to suppress the growth of breast cancer cells.',

The egg is then swept into the funnel-like end of one of the fallopian tubes, the usual site for fertilization.If the egg is fertilized by a sperm, then approximately three weeks after the first day of a woman   s last period, the fertilized egg (zygote) is moved slowly along the fallopian tube towards the uterus, by tiny cilia that line the tube.Week 4-In weeks 4 to 5, the embryo starts to grow and develop, with the inner cells starting to form two and then three layers. An inner layer referred to as the endoderm is formed, which goes on to become the baby   s breathing and digestive system. Week 5-It is during this week of pregnancy that a woman misses her period.

When sleep was measured objectively, however, women slept 16 minutes lon-ger than men, had a 1.2 percent higher sleep efficiency, and had less fragmented sleep.

Sleep medication use was more common in women (14.9%) than men (6.1%), and both sleep medication use and depressive symptoms were related to significantly shorter subjective sleep time in women. Men consumed twice as much alco-hol as women (1.0 drink/day versus 0.5 drink/day), and only alcohol consumption decreased the sex difference in actigraphic total sleep time. According to the authors, the sex differences in both self-reported and objective sleep measures may be explained by the fact that women may require more sleep than men, meaning the same amount of sleep may be satisfactory for men but not for women.

As people age, many of our cognitive abilities start to slowly decline. Specific interventions such as keeping socially, mentally, and physically active in addition to adopting correct dietary changes can slow down cognitive decline in elderly individuals.Cognitive Decline as a Part of Ageing-As we age, many of our cognitive abilities start to decline. These include impairments to short term working memory, processing speed, retrieval of memories/information, attention, and problem-solving.Subtle and gradual decline as you age is a part of the normal aging process. However, more rapid and progressive cognitive decline is usually indicative of dementia – which is not a part of healthy aging.Improving Cognitive Abilities in Older People Social/Leisure Activities & Brain Training Games-Elderly adults who regularly engage socially with other people; either through support groups, church groups, and supportive roles in schools, for example, can successfully maintain and improve cognitive and mental wellbeing. Being socially active also requires increased motivation to do so, moderate physical activity – all which have beneficial outcomes for cognitive health in older adults. Physical Activity-Physical activity increases bodily blood flow and oxygen levels including to the brain as well. Some studies have shown that those that simply walked more blocks were less likely to demonstrate declines in cognition 5-10 years later on, with those with the highest levels of physical activity having a 20% risk reduction for cognitive decline and dementia. Nutrition/Diet-Nutrition and diet in younger or mid-aged individuals have been shown to have a profound effect on cognitive ability later in life.This includes the consumption of the Mediterranean diet    comprising of fresh fruits, vegetables, fish (omega 3), with very little red meat and refined carbohydrates/grains and sugar.',

        { title: 'Better healthcare processes can reduce the risk of delirium among elderly patients', id: '3',content:'Reviewed by Emily Henderson, B.Sc. Jul 23 2021 Elderly patients with neurological conditions are significantly more likely to develop delirium shortly after they are hospitalized. A new study has discovered that a delayed transfer to a hospital floor is associated with greater short-term risk of delirium among patients aged 65 and over, and for those who arrive to the Emergency Department (ED) on days with higher risk of prolonged lengths of stay - found to be Sunday and Tuesday. Delirium is an acute cognitive disorder characterized by altered awareness, attentional deficits, confusion, and disorientation. Current estimates of new-onset delirium highlight the fact that delirium overwhelmingly develops in medical settings (as high as 82 per cent in intensive care settings) compared to the community at large (between one per cent and two per cent). Research has shown that between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of all delirium cases are preventable. The findings showed that of the 858 patients who presented to the ED with a neurological emergency, delirium was documented in 234 (30 per cent) patients within the first 72 hours from ED arrival. Mr. Moura has outlined several measures which can be taken to help prevent the likelihood of the onset of delirium in these settings, as well as reduce spending.Valdery Moura Junior, who is also computer scientist and technical leader at the Mass General Brigham, a Boston-based non-profit hospital and physicians network that includes Brigham and Women   s Hospital (BWH) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), two of the Harvard Medical School   s most prestigious teaching hospitals, said:New-onset delirium in older patients alone will mean a high price for the health care system and poses a global challenge for healthcare managers, providers, and payors. Managing hospital capacity has been an enormous challenge throughout the pandemic, with many admission processes reviewed as a result with the goal of improving patient outcomes.  ',

Due to poor job security and high competition to secure college places, a lot of parents find themselves micromanaging their children to give them that added boost, but can this be detrimental to the child?What is Helicopter Parenting?->Helicopter parenting is often referred to as the over part in over-parenting. It involves excessive levels of involvement and control by parents in their children   s lives. A motivation for this parenting style is driven by the parents    worry that their child might come to harm or not flourish.Negative Effects of Helicopter Parenting->Parental involvement in a child   s life can be extremely beneficial, but only if it is developmentally appropriate.

There are certain phases during childhood in which social anxiety is experienced by a majority of children. Classifying social anxiety->Social anxiety disorder is usually divided into two main categories. Symptoms of social anxiety disorder in children->Children with social anxiety disorder show some signs and symptoms that are not seen in normal children. These may be physical, emotional, or behavioral, and might include:  --Excessive crying--Excessive reliance on parents or caregivers--Throwing tantrums very frequently--Avoidance of interactions with friends and adults--Having problems with meeting other children or mingling with groups.Causes->There are several different causes that may lead to the development of a social anxiety disorder in a child. Situations where the child fails to perform properly and experiences embarrassment are often associated with an increased chance of social anxiety.Treatment approaches->Patients with childhood social anxiety respond well to psychological therapy as compared to when only self-help treatment methods are utilized. The main aim of treatment is to change the child   s behavior from provoking the disorder. Psychological therapy->Psychological treatment may be summarized by the two chief modes of therapy, namely cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and exposure therapy. CBT->CBT is a very effective treatment option for children with anxiety disorders. Exposure therapy->Exposure therapy involves a therapist who gradually exposes the child to situations that are associated with their anxiety. Pharmaceutical treatment->Pharmaceutical treatment for social anxiety disorders in children involves the use of medications to alleviate the symptoms of anxiety when the child confronts the anxiety-inducing situation.Involvement of parents and caregivers->Children usually trust their parents, as the connection or bond between the child and their parents is very strong. To this end, some tips are available to help parents and caregivers in facilitating the successful management of this disorder at home, such as:-Paying more attention to the feelings of the child--Not punishing the child for mistakes--Not punishing the child for getting low grades or for lack of progress.',

        { title: 'How is Infant Mental Health Measured?', id: '3',content:'By Benedette Cuffari, M.Sc. Reviewed by Emily Henderson, B.Sc. Infant mental health (IMH) is defined as the young child   s capacity to experience, regulate, and express emotions, form close and secure relationships, as well as explore their environment and learn, particularly from their primary caregivers. What is IMH? The term infant mental health (IMH) was originally established in the early 1970s under the direction of Slema Fraiberg. At this time, Fraiberg and her colleagues focused on the social, emotional, and cognitive health patterns of all children under the age of three. Thus, IMH became a term used to describe the wellbeing of infants and toddlers, as well as their parents. One of the primary focuses of IMH is how the parent-child relationship contributes to the social, behavioral, cognitive, and even physical development of the child. Moreover, the ability of the parents to be nurturing, responsive, and consistent in their treatment of the child is a crucial aspect of how both the infant   s external and internal experiences are formed. Promoting IMH-Overall, IMH services look to promote the optimal wellbeing of infants beginning in pregnancy and continuing through the first three years of the child   s life. In doing so, IMH services aim to prevent developmental, behavioral, and relational disturbances to the child while also offering interventions in the event that any biological, environmental, and/or psychosocial risk factors are identified, particularly in the parent-child relationship. Assessing IMH-When IMH is focused on the health of the child, there are various questions that healthcare providers can ask to determine their development, behavior, and relationship patterns. Some of the initial questions that the healthcare provider will ask include the age of the infant, their gestational age at birth, and any history of medical complications.Conclusion-Taken together, these types of questions allow IMH specialists to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the infant and their parents. Furthermore, it allows the specialist to gain identify the infant   s emotional capacities, as well as the caregiving abilities of the parents, particularly during moments when the child may be fussy/difficult to handle.',

Babies cry, because that is their primary means of communicating to their caregivers. While some babies are fussier than others, all babies cry. For the reason that babies cannot talk, it is easy for people to overlook their needs and wants. Reasons why infants cry-The first thing a parent or caregiver should try to identify when confronted with a crying baby is the reason for the child   s crying. This becomes easier the more time that is spent with the child or with experience nurturing infants. The reasons why infants cry may be many, but there are some common ones. Soothing a crying infant-Although all babies are individuals and unique in their own respects, some tips and tricks, with regards to soothing them when crying, do seem to be universal. The first and most important thing a parent or caregiver should remember is to never ever shake a baby. Shaking an infant can cause what is called Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS). Its hallmarks are retinal and subdural hemorrhages. Colic-Although poorly understood with a yet to be identified clear cause, colic is the term used for crying in babies that lasts longer than 3 hours in a day for more than 3 days in a week over the course of 3 or more weeks in a child who is otherwise healthy. These babies have a higher pitched crying and often look like they are in pain with rigid tummies and bodies as well as flexed limbs. Coping with a crying infant-It is very normal that many parents, especially those who are new to parenthood, may become worried by not being able to understand all of their babys cries. Furthermore, it may even be frustrating at times. It is imperative to remember that crying is a part of the baby package. Parents should take time out to understanding their babies more and always seek support from family and close friends when they feel overwhelmed.        ',

        { title: 'What is Type 1 Diabetes?', id: '1',content:'By Dr. Ananya Mandal, MD Reviewed by Sally Robertson, B.Sc. Type 1 diabetes mellitus describes a condition where the body cannot produce insulin which leads to a very high level of blood sugar and associated complications. The condition, which usually develops in childhood or adolescence, affects millions of people worldwide. Types of diabetes and their pathology->There are two main types of diabetes which include:Type 1 diabetes is also called juvenile diabetes mellitus because it usually begins before the age of 25 years, accounting for 95% of diabetes in people from this age group. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas fails to produce adequate amounts of insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels and helps the body utilize sugar. The insulin is not produced because the body   s immune system mistakes the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas for foreign bodies and mounts an immune attack against them that causes their destruction. Individuals with type 1 diabetes are therefore dependent on insulin injections for their blood sugar to be regulated. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes mellitus->There are three main symptoms of diabetes which include polydipsia (increased thirst), polyphagia (increased hunger) and polyuria (increased frequency of urination). In addition, patients may complain of fatigue, weight loss and loss of muscle bulk. Type 1 diabetes can develop very quickly, over weeks or even days.Diagnosis and treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus->Early diagnosis and treatment is vital in type 1 diabetes. Diagnosis involves the assessment of blood sugar and insulin levels and treatment is aimed at maintaining blood sugar at an around normal level.If left untreated, type 1 diabetes can lead to several complications such as diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease), diabetic retinopathy (damage to the retina of the eye) and neuropathy (nerve damage). Since type 1 diabetes is caused due to a lack of insulin, insulin injections are used to normalize the blood sugar level.',

        { title: 'Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 Pathophysiology', id: '2' ,content:'By Dr. Ananya Mandal, MD Reviewed by Sally Robertson, B.Sc. Type 1 diabetes occurs as a result of the body   s immune system attacking the insulin producing beta cells of the pancreas, although it is not clear why this happens. A lack of insulin in the blood means inadequate amounts of glucose are taken up by cells of the body to provide energy for cellular functions. Consequently, glucose remains in the blood leading to a high blood sugar level. Exactly what causes the immune system to do this is not yet clearly understood but some hypotheses include:Viral infection - Some research has suggested that the immune system is activated in response to viral infection. As the immune cells are activated against the virus particles, they are also activated against the beta cells of the pancreas. Viruses that have been implicated in the causation of type 1 diabetes include the coxsackie and rubella viruses.Genetic tendency - Type 1 diabetes seems to run in families which suggests a genetic basis to the pathology of the condition. Some HLA genotypes are known to raise the risk of developing type 1 diabetes.Development of antibodies - Some researchers have suggested that the development of antibodies against proteins in cow   s milk may also lead to the development of antibodies that attack the beta cells of the pancreas. The presence of antibodies against pancreatic beta cells is seen in a subtype of type 1 diabetes mellitus.There is speculation that lack of vitamin D in the first year of a child   s life may raise the risk of type 1 diabetes developing.Certain drugs and chemicals may also play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes by destroying the pancreatic beta cells. These include chemicals such as pyrinuron (Vacor, N-3-pyridylmethyl-N   -p-nitrophenyl urea) which is used as a rat poison and is no longer used in the USA. An anticancer and antibiotic agent called streptozotocin used to treat pancreatic cancer also destroys the pancreatic beta cells.',

Since there is no cure for type 1 diabetes, treatment is focused on controlling the condition effectively in order to minimize symptoms and delay disease progression. The disease is caused by damaged or destroyed pancreatic beta cells that fail to secrete insulin. Insulin is a vital hormone that stimulates the uptake of glucose in the blood by muscles, fat, liver and other cells of the body so it can be used an energy source for various cellular functions. Since individuals with type 1 diabetes lack insulin, the main focus of treatment is insulin replacement therapy. Regular insulin injections timed in conjunction with meal times coupled with regular exercise can maintain blood sugar at a level that is as normal as possible and help to prevent symptoms and delay the onset of complications.Treatment outline for type 1 diabetes-After diabetes is diagnosed, the patient is usually referred to an endocrinologist, a specialist in hormonal systems. The endocrinologist develops a long-term treatment plan during which the patient   s is closely monitored for adequate blood sugar control and signs of diabetes complications.In addition to taking insulin, the patient is encouraged to adopt a healthy lifestyle and to partake in monitored physical exercise regularly, to eat a low-calorie, balanced, healthy diet and to cease any smoking or drinking habits. The patient needs to check for signs of complication such as hypoglycemia or a sudden fall in blood sugar and should attend regular screening for other complications of the disease such as retinopathy, nephropathy, diabetic foot and heart disease.It is important for patients to be to be aware that conditions such as ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia can cause a loss of consciousness and diabetic coma. The insulin preparations used for supplementation are available with different durations of action. For example, while some can provide blood sugar reducing effect over a short period of time after meals, others control it for up to 8 to 12 hours or longer.',

        { title: 'Type 2 Diabetes Symptoms', id: '4' ,content:'By Dr. Ananya Mandal, MD Reviewed by Sally Robertson, B.Sc. Type 2 diabetes is typically characterized by high blood sugar. The blood sugar is high because the insulin-induced uptake of glucose from the blood by various cells of the body is either reduced or absent. The progression of type 2 diabetes usually occurs gradually, over many years. In some people, there may be no symptoms of type 2 diabetes until it has developed or progressed to a more severe extent. Some of the main symptoms of type 2 diabetes include:--Polydipsia - increased thirst--Polyphagia - increased hunger--Polyuria - frequency of urination is increased, especially at night. Other symptoms of type 2 diabetes include:-Tiredness and fatigue-Unexplained weight loss and muscle loss.-Diabetics are prone to infection because the high blood sugar provides a favourable growth medium for microbes. Diabetics are also less able to defend against these infections. Fungal infections of the vulva in females are common leading to itching and urinary tract infections may occur in both in men and women.-Diabetic individuals may also develop non-healing foot ulcers or sores which can turn gangrenous if left untreated. Diabetes complications->Eventually, serious complications of the disease may arise and affect various bodily systems. For example, the following may develop:Retinopathy->Floaters   or floating dark spots in the field of vision may occur as a result of damage caused to the retina by an inadequate supply of nutrients and oxygen by blood vessels. This occurs due to the microvascular changes that diabetes causes in the eye.Diabetic neuropathy->This refers to the nerve damage caused by diabetes which may lead to tingling, pain or numbness in affected areas. Usually, the peripheries such as the toes and fingers are the first to be affected.The autonomic nervous system may also be affected causing disorder of bodily systems such as the digestive, reproductive and urinary systems.Cardiovascular disease->The risks of heart disease is also raised in diabetic individuals which increases the likelihood of heart attacks, heart failure, high blood pressure and stroke.

Too much consumption of high-calorie foods, such as fast foods, fatty meats, refined grains, fried foods, and sweetened foods/beverages is believed to be the most considerable cause of increasing prevalence of diabetes worldwide.According to the scientific literature, a plant-based diet comprised primarily of vegetables, fruits, legumes, seeds, nuts, and whole grains is very effective in managing type 2 diabetes, as well as reducing comorbidities, such as obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular problems, kidney disorders, and hyperlipidemia.Consumption of animal products is associated with fat  deposition in body cells, which interferes with the normal insulin   s function of transporting glucose from the blood into the cells. This subsequently increases the glucose level in the blood, leading to development of hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes. Because a plant-based diet contains very little saturated fat, fat deposition is reduced and insulin function can be maintained. It has been found that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is 2.9% among vegan people, whereas the prevalence is 7.8% among people who mostly eat animal products.Hormones released from the small intestine (incretin hormones), such as glucagon-like peptide -1 and gastric inhibitory peptide, play an important role in managing overall glucose metabolism and maintaining glucose homeostasis. A plant-based diet helps increase the secretion of incretin hormones and improve the pancreatic beta cell function, insulin release, and insulin sensitivity.Apart from managing diabetes well, a plant-base diet  can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes as it contains high amounts of antioxidants, micronutrients, fibers, and unsaturated fatty acids, which are known to have protective effects against diabetes. It has been found that the level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), which is a biomarker to define impaired glucose metabolism, remains stable in diabetic patients who follow a strict vegetarian diet.' ,
